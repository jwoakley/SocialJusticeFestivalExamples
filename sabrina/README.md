# Sabrina's Project 03

## Project Overview

<h5>CL1MATE is a festival dedicated to raise awareness on environmental injustices. Additionally, it aims to reach an international audience so that everyone in the world can hopefully learn more about how  environmental issues align with different social issues (classism, racism, etc). By using various visual elements, such as illustrations and collages, this will help the audience break down complex issues that revolve around environmental abuse. </h5>
