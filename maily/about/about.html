      <h1>What Does "Destigmatization" Mean?</h1>
      <!-- </div>
    <div id="subtitle"> -->


      <h2>It can feel like a big word...</h2>
    </div>


    <div id="body">
      <p>Destigmatization means to remove the association of shame. Talking about mental health is often hard because
      people carry a sense of shame or judgment around the issue. This is because our society has created an
      environment where people think that mental health issues are a bad thing, that they hinder a person, that
      emotions should be kept in the dark, or people do not want to hear about your “problems.” But we are in an age
      where 1 in 4 people suffer from at least one mental health issue and it is time to break the shame around
      speaking about it. Too many lives have been lost, too many battles faced alone, too many people suffering in
      silence. Destigmatization is a step towards fostering an environment where people can speak openly about their
      mental health, communicate their needs, receive support, and reach resources.</p>

      <h2>We are Proud to Support the Mental Health Coalition</h2>


      <p>The Mental Health Coalition is a non-profit organization founded in 2020 amid the peak of the pandemic. They
      strive to end the stigma around mental health, foster open conversations, and fight the feeling of being a
      “square peg in a round hole.” <br><em>Profits from the festival will be donated to the Mental Health Coalition in
      support of its mission.</em></p>
